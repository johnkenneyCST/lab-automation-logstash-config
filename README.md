# Description 
- This repo contains the config files for all the liquid handlers going into logstash/elastic search
- This file structure is derived from the original logstash download with an individual config file for any/all systems.
- At this time the file structure contains the following:
    - dev
        - _banting (for hamilton robot banting)_
        - _cloud-dev (for development locally but connects to the cloud dev environment)_
        - _i5 (for biomek robot i5)_
        - _i7 (for biomek robot)_
        - _local-dev (strictly for local dev configured for elastic search, kibana, and logstash all to run on the local environment)_
        - _macleod (hamilton robot)_
        - _onnes (hamilton robot)_
        - _starlet (hamilton robot)_
        - _vlad (hamilton robot)_
     
- The goal is to build out a dev, test, and eventually prod environment for all of these.

## Setup 
TBD
